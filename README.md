# EDMC-Screenshot
A plugin for EDMC that detects screenshot events are converts them to PNG format

The plugin takes the existing screenshot file and generate a new name based on the mask System(Body)_nnn.png
The converted file can be saved to a different directory from the orginal file. The original file can optionally be deleted.
